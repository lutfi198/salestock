Infinite List and Detail View for Planets in SWAPI

1. Oracle JET framework
2. Hosting in Firebase Hosting
3. Integrate with Firebase Realtime Database for storing Planetâ€™s Hit Count property
4. It has 2 different layout : small and other screen sizes

Known bugs :
In a small screen sizes : If we click one planet and return again to list view, somehow the list goes to top not last position. (I am using scrollTo but still ongoing investigation)
